## Title of the Project
Agriculture faces a host of challenges, from unpredictable weather conditions to soil degradation and plant diseases. These issues can reduce crop yields, increase costs, and impact food security. AgriGo is a web application designed to bridge the gap between modern agricultural practices and advanced technologies like machine learning and deep learning. By providing tools for crop disease detection, fertilizer recommendations, and crop selection advice, AgriGo empowers farmers to make data-driven decisions and optimize their farming processes.

## Problem statement
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->Farming is becoming increasingly complex due to:
Limited access to expert advice for small-scale farmers.
Inefficiency in crop selection based on soil and environmental conditions.
Lack of knowledge about fertilizers to use for specific soil and crop types.
Crop diseases going undetected, leading to reduced productivity.
AgriGo addresses these challenges with an easy-to-use platform that integrates scientific analysis into daily agricultural practices.
